## Data 
### Training Data: UTK FACE
The data used to train the age classifcation model comes from the [UTK Face](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/) database. The specific data used is the "Aligned & Cropped Faces" file. 

The labels of each face image is embedded in the file name, formated like [age]_[gender]_[race]_[date&time].jpg
| :---        |    :----:   | 
| age         | is an integer from 0 to 116, indicating the age | 
| gender      | is either 0 (male) or 1 (female)       | 
| race        | is an integer from 0 to 4, denoting White, Black, Asian, Indian, and Others (like Hispanic, Latino, Middle Eastern) |
| date&time   | is in the format of yyyymmddHHMMSSFFF, showing the date and time an image was collected to UTKFace        |


### Test Data: NBA
